# Robo-Kart
## Authors: Jake Findlow, Jackson Ravelli, Danielle Whitmarsh

Our goal of this project is to create a self-driving robot that can navigate through a track at a selected speed, 
reacting to different colors along the way. We eventually want to make this into a game where multiple robots can verse each other, 
without having to have human interference to fix interruptions.
We also would find it beneficial if the robots can attempt to avoid incoming obstructions on the track.
