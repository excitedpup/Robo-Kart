# Robo-Kart
## Authors: Jake Findlow, Jackson Ravelli, Danielle Whitmarsh

Our goal of this project is to create a self-driving robot that can navigate through a track at a selected speed, 
reacting to different colors along the way. We eventually want to make this into a game where multiple robots can verse each other, 
without having to have human interference to fix interruptions.
We also would find it beneficial if the robots can attempt to avoid incoming obstructions on the track.

Needed to run code:

1. Spike Prime Robot and library or vs code extention.  
2. Set up robot with:

    ColorSensor in port A pointing to the left ground
    ColorSensor in port b pointing to the right ground
    left motor in port C
    right motor in port D
    distance sensor in port F facing ahead on the front
    force sensor in port E placed on the back of the robot
